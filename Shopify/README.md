# Shopify App Analysis 


## Figured out what key factors play into the success of a Shopify app 

Identified the average review rating of the app. 
Used a DAX formula to weigh the reviews by how helpful theyâ€™ve been found. 
Created a new relationship between the Reviews table and the Apps table.

I built this project using pages in a Power BI report. 
This project addressed the knowledge gap surrounding the factors driving success in Shopify app.  
Technology Used: Power BI Reports.  
This project took 14 days from start to finish. 
I completed this project by myself. 
  
### Conclusions


There is a positive correlation between the app's performance and user satisfaction. The developer with the highest sum of ratings has a relatively low average of helpful reviews. The developers with the lower sums of ratings have higher average of helpful reviewes. 


### Recommendations

I would recommend that the developers focus of quality of quantity, aiming for more helpful reviews than a large number of reviews. I would recommend for the developers to be provided with training that can help improve the quality of their reviews.
