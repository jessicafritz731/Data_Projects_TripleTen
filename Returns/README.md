### Conclusions


When looking at Return Rate by Product Category, we see that Office Supplies is the category with the most returns. When using the subcategory filter to identify the root cause, we see that binders and paper are the Office Supplies subcategories with the most returns. Binders make up 552 of the Office Supplies returns. While paper makes up 487 of the Office Supplies returns. When looking at Return Rate by Month, we see that there is a dramatic spike in returns in August and September. When looking at Profit and Returns by Region and Category, we see that the West region has the largest profit/return disparity, which is located in the Furniture category.


### Recommendations

Each customer that makes a return should be provided with a brief survey to help the company understand the reason for the return. This additional data will allow for more informed and specified decision making. Identify the concerns in the subcategories with the highest return rates. Is there an issue with their quality? Is the description of the item inaccurate, causing customers to receive something other than what they expected?"
