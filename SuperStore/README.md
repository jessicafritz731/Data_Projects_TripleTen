## Analyzing data from online store to deepen business understanding. 


Developed metrics to recommend which products to stop selling at the store.   
Identified top 3 most profitable states, and their most profitable months.   
Visualized the return rate of each item sold at the store.  


Built Tableau workbook to review the superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.
This project solved financial problems within the superstore by identidying profits and losses. 
Technlogy Used: Tableua Public 
This project took 14 days from start to finish. 
I developed this project by myself. 
  
### Conclusions

Tables and bookcases are the two products causing the biggest losses. Indiana, Rhode Island, and Vermont are the top 3 most profitable states. Utah is the state with the highest return rate. 


### Recommendations

I would recommend that the business stops selling tables and bookcases, and these products have been causing significant losses. I would recommend that the store analyzses the customer demographics and purchase behavior of the customers in Indiana, Rhode Island, and Vermont. This could provide key insight as to why these states are more profitable than the rest. I would recommend that the store takes a look at the shipping and production methods of the products in Utah to better understand why there are so many returns.
