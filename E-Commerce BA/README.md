## Analyze the business's purchase data to help them make better decisions. 


Created a conversion funnel to better understand how users interact with the website.
Built acquisition cohorts based on the month of a userâ€™s first purchase, and tracked cohort metrics month by month.
Aggregate the purchase data into cohorts and then calculated retention rates for each cohort month by month. 


I created a Google sheets report 
It solved the problem of the knowlegde gap surrounding the purchase data. 
I used Google sheets. 
This project took 14 days from start to finish. 
I completed this project by myself.  
  
### Conclusions


10.34% of users who viewed the page ended up making a purchase. 35.61% of users who put an item in their cart ended up making a purchase. 5 out of 6 cohorts had a decline in their retention rate from month 1 to month 2. 4 out of 6 cohorts had a 0% retention rate by month 4. 


### Recommendations

Based on the results, I recommend focusing on improving the conversion funnel to increase the percentage of users who complete a purchase. Currently, only 10.34% of users who view the page end up making a purchase, indicating a significant drop-off. Additionally, addressing the decline in retention rates from month 1 to month 4 can help reduce customer churn and increase long-term revenue.
