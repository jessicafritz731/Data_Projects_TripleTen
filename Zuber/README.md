## Use SQL to analyze Chicago taxi and weather data to gain insights into ride patterns, company performance, and weather impacts.

Analyzed taxi trip data / Identified top-performing taxi companies by ride volume / Ranked companies based on the number of trips for November 15-16, 2017.
Aggregated ride data / Filtered taxi companies by name containing "Yellow" or "Blue" / Calculated total rides for these companies between November 1-7, 2017.

Categorized weather conditions / Joined weather and trip data / Determined the impact of rain and storms on taxi trips originating in the Loop and ending at O'Hare.

I built SQL queries to analyze a dataset of Chicago taxi trips, cab information, weather records, and neighborhood details. The goal was to extract meaningful insights into ride patterns, company performance, and the influence of weather on taxi usage.

This project addressed the need to understand trends and relationships within the taxi data, providing actionable insights for potential business decisions, such as identifying peak hours, popular routes, and the impact of weather on ridership.

WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DID YOU USE?

SQL (specifically, queries designed for a relational database with tables: trips, cabs, weather_records, and neighborhoods).

HOW MANY WEEKS/MONTHS DID IT TAKE TO COMPLETE?

This project was completed in 14 days. 

I completed this project independently. 

Conclusions
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to use SQL to extract valuable insights from a complex dataset. By analyzing taxi trip data, company information, weather records, and neighborhood details, I was able to identify key trends and relationships, such as top-performing taxi companies, the impact of weather on ridership, and popular routes. The use of SQL allowed for efficient data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation, enabling the extraction of actionable information.

Recommendations
For future enhancements, this analysis could be expanded to include more advanced statistical techniques, such as time series analysis to forecast ridership patterns or machine learning models to predict trip duration. Additionally, integrating real-time data sources could provide more up-to-date insights and enable dynamic decision-making. Exploring the impact of external factors, such as events or holidays, could further enhance the analysis. Finally, visualizing the results through dashboards or interactive reports would make the findings more accessible and impactful for stakeholders.
